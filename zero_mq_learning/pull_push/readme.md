# ZeroMQ PUSH–PULL Pattern (Theory)

## 🧠 Concept

**PUSH–PULL** is a **pipeline** pattern in ZeroMQ.

It’s used when you have **one or more producers** (that generate tasks or messages) and **one or more workers/consumers** (that process them).

- **PUSH socket** → sends messages **downstream**
- **PULL socket** → receives messages **upstream**

ZeroMQ automatically **load-balances** messages between multiple PULL sockets (workers).  
Each message goes to only one worker — no duplication.

## ⚙️ Architecture
Producer (PUSH) →→→ Worker(s) (PULL)


- The **producer** PUSHes messages.
- Each **worker** PULLs one message at a time and processes it.

You can have:
- 1 producer → many workers
- many producers → 1 or many workers

## 🔍 Use Cases

- Task queues / job distribution  
- Parallel workers  
- Log collection  
- Stream processing pipelines

## ✅ Summary

| Role | Socket Type | Action |
|------|--------------|--------|
| Producer | PUSH | Sends tasks |
| Worker | PULL | Receives and processes |

### Key Points
- Simple, fast, no message broker required  
- Automatic load balancing  
- One-way communication (no replies)
