\# 🔌 Python Sockets (Beginner Guide)



\## 📝 What is a Socket?

\- A \*\*socket\*\* is like a "door" between two programs on a network.  

\- It allows them to \*\*send\*\* and \*\*receive\*\* data.  

\- Think of it as a \*\*phone line\*\*: one side "calls" (client), the other side "answers" (server).

\## 📡 Client and Server

Networking usually has two roles:



1\. \*\*Server\*\*

&nbsp;  - Listens for connections.

&nbsp;  - Provides a service (like a website, chat server, etc.).



2\. \*\*Client\*\*

&nbsp;  - Connects to a server.

&nbsp;  - Requests or sends data.

\## 🛠️ Socket Types

\- \*\*TCP: transmission control protocol (SOCK\_STREAM)\*\*: Reliable, connection oriented (like WhatsApp messages).  

\- \*\*UDP: user data gram protocol (SOCK\_DGRAM)\*\*: Fast, connection less, but no guarantee (like live video streaming).
